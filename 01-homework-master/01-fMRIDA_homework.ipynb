    "fMRI is a method of brain imaging which consists of registering in which areas of the brain is most active at a given moment (e.g. while performing some activity). **It works in such a way that the oxygen in our blood is subjected to an external magnetic field (i.e. an MRI). In this way, the oxygen atoms are magnetised and become the source of the magnetic field themselves, thus emitting energy, which is recorded and then converted into an image. Stronger oxygenated blood flows through areas that are currently more active than others,** so that we can classify these particular brain fragments as activated."
